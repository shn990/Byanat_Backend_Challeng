# Byanat_Backend_Challenge
This project is an atempt to solve a task according to Byanat instructions.
Time and effort were spent days ago in order to finish it, however the challenge was to learn lots of things
within limited timeframe.
I am new to this field, as I am specialized in network and data communication in my Bachelor degree.
In this project, I was able to retrieve data from the provided url, but the challenge was how to parse the data, and give comand to filter 
them according to user input.

Thanks.
